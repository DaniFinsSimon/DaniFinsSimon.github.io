<h1 class="hola"> Dog Poem</h1>
<p class="ei">
    When a dog offers you his heart<br>
    Accept it with a smile<br>
    For his love will last a lifetime<br>
    Which is such a little while.<br> </p>

<p class="ei">
    When a dog offers you his heart<br>
    Take it gladly and with pride<br>
    For he will be a faithful friend<br>
    Ever by your side.<br></p>
<p class="ei">

    A dog loves you because you're you<br>
    Not for how you speak or what job you do<br>
    You could be short, tall, thin or fat<br>
    Or ugly as sin, he doesn't care about that.<br></p>

<p class="ei">

    A dog knows if you're good or bad<br>
    He can see inside your soul<br>
    When he decides you're okay<br>
    To earn your love is his main goal.<br></p>

<p class="ei">
    When you're sad, he'll comfort you<br>
    And kiss away each tear<br>
    You may even wake up in the morning<br>
    With a cold nose in your ear.<br></p>

<p class="ei">When eventually the time comes<br>
    And the lights in his eyes dim<br>
    A new star will shine in Heaven<br>
    In remembrance of him.<br></p>

<p class="ei"> You'll gaze up at the midnight sky<br>
    And you will hear him say -<br>
    "I'm so glad you were my human<br>
    We'll meet again some day!"<br> </p>

<p class="ei">  So, if this poem has caused a tear to fall<br>
    That's because you love the dog who's giving you his all<br>
    Go travel on together, happily paw in glove<br>
    He's the only one who'll ever give you unconditional love.<br></p>

<p class="ei">   When a dog offers you his heart<br>
    Accept it with a smile<br>
    For his love will last a lifetime -<br>
    Which is such a little while.<br> </p>
